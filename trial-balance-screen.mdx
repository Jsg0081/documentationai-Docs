## Overview

The Trial Balance screen is where you review accounts, balances, journal entry (JE) impact, and tax mapping for a client. From here you can:

- Search and filter accounts
- Edit account numbers and names inline
- Add accounts and journal entries
- Run cleanup tools on imported data
- Switch between flat and mapped (tax) views
- Drill into deltas and account details

Use this page as a tour of the screen layout, tools, and common troubleshooting patterns.

<Callout kind="info">

If you have not imported or created any accounts yet, the Trial Balance screen will be empty. You can add accounts manually or import a trial balance before using most tools.

</Callout>

## Layout overview

The Trial Balance screen has two main areas:

- **Top controls** with search, tools, actions, and view toggles
- **The trial balance grid** with accounts, balances, and totals

You can switch between:

- **Flat View**: a traditional trial balance grid.
- **Mapped View**: accounts grouped by tax mapping categories.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Use the top controls" icon="settings">

  - Adjust your view (Flat vs Mapped).
  - Run tools like **Clean Up**.
  - Add new accounts or journal entries.
  - Apply search and filters (for example, Hide Zeros).

  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the trial balance grid" icon="table">

  - Scan account-level balances and deltas.
  - Edit account numbers and names inline.
  - Drill into non-zero deltas for detailed journal entries.
  - Confirm totals and tax return checks at the bottom.

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Search and filtering

The top-left search and filters help you quickly narrow down the grid.

- **Search box**: filters accounts by number, name, or type.
- **Hide Zeros** button: hides rows where all columns are zero, so you only see active accounts.

<Callout kind="tip">

Use **Hide Zeros** after you post adjustments or reclasses to focus on accounts that changed or still require review.

</Callout>

## Editing accounts inline

You can edit account numbers and names directly from the grid without leaving the Trial Balance screen.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Edit an account number or name" icon="edit">

  - Click the **Account #** or **Account Name** cell you want to change.
  - Type the new value.
  - Press **Enter** to save, or **Esc** to cancel.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Respect account number rules" icon="alert-triangle">

  Rules for account numbers:

  - Account numbers must be **unique**.
  - If you enter a duplicate number, the grid shows a warning.
  - Resolve the warning by choosing a different number or adjusting the conflicting account.

  <Callout kind="danger">

  If you see an **account number already chosen** warning, pick a different number or delete/renumber the existing account. Keeping duplicate numbers can cause confusion in reporting and tax mapping.

  </Callout>

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Add accounts and journal entries

The top-right actions let you grow and adjust the trial balance as you work.

- **Add Account**: creates a new account row in the grid.
- **Add JE**: opens the Journal Entry dialog so you can post adjustments.
- **Journal Entry Summary**: appears when entries exist and shows a summary of JE impact on the trial balance.

Use these actions as you refine the imported data, add missing accounts, and post adjustments or reclasses.

## Clean Up tool

The **Clean Up** button runs an automated pass on your accounts to normalize imported data.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Run Clean Up" icon="play-circle">

  - Click **Clean Up** from the top controls.
  - The system normalizes account numbers and names.
  - A progress indicator appears while cleanup runs.
  - When finished, the grid updates in place with cleaned-up accounts.

  </Step>

  <Step title="When to use Clean Up" icon="info">

  Use the Clean Up tool **after importing messy trial balances**, especially when:

  - Account numbers have inconsistent formats.
  - Account names contain extra prefixes, suffixes, or formatting.
  - You want a cleaner, standardized chart of accounts before mapping or review.

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Flat View (standard grid)

Flat View shows the traditional trial balance grid with all account-level columns and deltas.

<Expandable title="Flat View columns" default-open="true">

Columns in Flat View include:

- **Account #**
- **Account Name**
- **Type**
- **Unadjusted**
- **Adjusting Δ**
- **Adjusted**
- **Reclass Δ**
- **Final**
- **Tax Δ**
- **Tax**

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Clickable deltas and drill-down" default-open="true">

Certain delta columns are clickable when they are non-zero:

- **Adjusting Δ**
- **Reclass Δ**
- **Tax Δ**

When a delta is **non-zero**, you can click it to open the detailed JE view for that account. This lets you:

- See which journal entries contribute to the delta.
- Confirm the direction and amount of each change.
- Trace adjustments, reclasses, and tax-only entries back to their source.

If a delta is zero, the cell is not clickable.

</Expandable>

## Totals and tax return check

At the bottom of the grid you will find summary rows and a tax return check section that help you confirm the trial balance is complete and tax-ready.

<Expandable title="Totals and summary rows" default-open="true">

The bottom of the grid includes:

- **TOTALS** row: shows totals across all columns.
- **NET INCOME** row: calculated as Revenue minus Expenses.

Use these to confirm your overall balances and that net income is flowing as expected.

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Tax Return Check details" default-open="false">

The **Tax Return Check** section shows:

- **Total Assets**
- **Total Liabilities**
- **Total Equity** (including Revenue and Expenses)
- **Total Liabilities + Equity** (a key balance check)

These values help you verify that:

- The trial balance is balanced.
- The tax mapping is consistent with the underlying accounting equation.
- You are ready to move from trial balance review to tax return preparation.

</Expandable>

## Mapped View (tax mapping view)

Mapped View groups accounts by tax return lines based on their tax mapping. This gives you a tax-focused view of the trial balance.

- Accounts are organized into tax mapping categories.
- You can still use **Search** and **Hide Zeros** in this view.
- It is useful for tax prep and review, especially when you want to see which accounts roll up to each tax line.

Switch between **Flat View** and **Mapped View** depending on whether you are doing accounting-focused cleanup or tax-focused review.

## Row click behavior

Clicking on a row (outside of an editable cell) opens more detail for that account.

- Clicking directly on an editable cell (Account # or Account Name) starts inline editing.
- Clicking elsewhere on the row opens the account details panel or drill-down view.
- Use row clicks to quickly jump from the grid into deeper account-level review.

## Common troubleshooting

<Expandable title="Troubleshooting messages and behaviors" default-open="true">

Common issues you may see on the Trial Balance screen include:

- **Account number already chosen**

  - Cause: You entered a number that is already assigned to another account.
  - Fix: Choose a different account number, or delete/renumber the existing account.

- **No accounts found**

  - Cause: The grid is empty or filtered down to zero results.
  - Fix: Import a trial balance, add accounts manually, or clear search/filters (for example, uncheck Hide Zeros).

- **Deltas do not open**

  - Cause: The delta you clicked is zero, so there are no underlying entries to show.
  - Fix: Make sure the delta is non-zero before clicking. If needed, post or import journal entries that affect that account.
