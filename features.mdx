## Automated Trial Balance Normalization

You upload trial balance data in CSV, Excel, or direct API, and Snappytb's AI normalizes it automatically. It standardizes account names like `Cash in Bank` to `1000 - Cash`, detects duplicates, and flags inconsistencies.

<Callout kind="tip">
Use consistent file formats for best results. Supported: CSV with columns `{Account Number}`, `{Account Name}`, `{Debit}`, `{Credit}`.
</Callout>

Snappytb analyzes your firm's history and IRS rules to suggest tax form categories. For example, `Interest Income` maps to Schedule B, Line 1.
