## Overview

The Org Chart gives you a visual map of a client&apos;s legal entities, ownership structure, and relationships. It is a fast way to confirm who owns what, how entities connect, and where percentages flow.

Use the Org Chart to:

- Add entities as nodes
- Connect them to show relationships
- Display ownership percentages
- Keep everything organized for review and communication

<Expandable title="When to use the Org Chart" default-open="true">

Org Charts are especially useful when:

- Ownership is complex  
  Multi-entity structures are difficult to interpret from spreadsheets. A chart makes relationships obvious at a glance.

- You are preparing tax workpapers  
  Clear ownership helps validate consolidation logic, related-party disclosures, and tax positions.

- You need to communicate structure clearly  
  Charts are client-friendly and useful for reviews, partner sign-off, or team handoffs.

- You are onboarding a new team member  
  Instead of walking through every file, the chart gives instant context.

<Callout kind="info">

You must have a client selected and a client binder open to use the Org Chart page.

</Callout>

## Getting started

Use these steps to open and access the Org Chart canvas.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Open a client binder" icon="folder">

  1. From the main workspace, select a client.
  2. Open that client&apos;s binder.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to the Org Chart tab" icon="circle-dot-dashed">

  1. In the binder, go to the **Org Chart** tab.
  2. If no chart exists yet, you will see a blank canvas.

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Working with nodes (entities and owners)

Nodes represent companies, entities, or owners. You can create, edit, move, and delete nodes on the canvas.

### Create a new node

<Steps>

  <Step title="Add an entity or owner" icon="plus">

  1. Click **New Node**.
  2. Enter the **entity name**.
  3. Optionally add a **percentage** (ownership or interest).
  4. Choose a **shape**.
  5. Choose a **color**.
  6. Click **Create**.
  7. The node appears on the canvas.

  </Step>

</Steps>

<Expandable title="Available node shapes">

You can choose from these shapes to visually differentiate node types:

- Rectangle
- Rounded
- Pill
- Circle

Use shapes and colors together to group similar entities or highlight special roles.

</Expandable>

### Edit an existing node

<Steps>

  <Step title="Open node for editing" icon="edit">

  1. On the canvas, **double-click** a node.
  2. Update the **name**, **percentage**, **shape**, or **color** as needed.
  3. Click **Save** to apply your changes.

  </Step>

</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">

Double-clicking a node is the quickest way to edit it.

</Callout>

### Delete a node

<Steps>

  <Step title="Remove a node from the chart" icon="trash">

  1. Double-click the node you want to remove.
  2. Click **Delete** to confirm.

  </Step>

</Steps>

<Callout kind="alert">

Deleting a node also removes any connected lines and relationships. Review the node&apos;s connections before you delete it.

</Callout>

### Move and arrange nodes

You can drag nodes anywhere on the canvas. Positions are saved automatically so your layout stays consistent.

Use this to organize:

- Parent entities above
- Subsidiaries below
- Owners to the left, operating entities to the right

## Creating and managing relationships

Links (edges) show relationships between nodes, such as ownership chains or parent-subsidiary connections.

### Create ownership links

<Steps>

  <Step title="Connect two nodes" icon="zap">

  1. On the canvas, start from the source node.
  2. Drag from that node toward the target node.
  3. Drop onto the target node.
  4. A line appears, representing the relationship between them.

  </Step>

</Steps>

Use these links to represent:

- Ownership chains
- Parent-subsidiary relationships
- Operating structure flows

### Delete relationships

To remove an existing relationship:

- Click the line and delete it.
- Or select the line and press **Delete** (if supported by your browser).

<Callout kind="danger">

Deleting a relationship removes that connection from the chart. It does not delete the underlying nodes, but it can change how ownership flows appear, so review before removing key links.

</Callout>

## Percentage field

The percentage field is optional and is displayed beneath the node label.

Use it for:

- Ownership percentages
- Economic interest
- Voting control percentages

Example usages:

- `ABC Holdings` with `75%`
- `John Smith` with `25%`

Only enter percentages when they are known and confirmed for the entity or owner.

## Visual tools

The Org Chart includes built-in tools to help you work with large or complex structures:

- **Mini-map**: A small overview in the corner that helps you see and navigate large charts.
- **Zoom and pan controls**: Adjust your view to focus on specific parts of the structure or step back for a full overview.
- **Grid background**: Helps you align nodes and keep the chart visually clean.

These tools make it easier to manage extensive org charts without losing context.

## Best practices

<Expandable title="Suggested layout and style practices" default-open="true">

To keep charts readable and reliable:

- Use **consistent colors** for related entities.
- Put **holding entities** above **operating entities**.
- Use **percentages only when confirmed**.
- Keep charts clean and focused. For very complex structures, split into logical sections when needed.

</Expandable>

## Quick summary

The Org Chart is your visual map of a client&apos;s structure:

- Add entities and owners as nodes.
- Connect them to show relationships and flows.
- Display ownership or interest percentages as needed.
- Use layout, shapes, colors, and built-in tools to keep everything organized for review.
