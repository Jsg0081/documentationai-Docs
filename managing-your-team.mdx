## Overview

SnappyTB lets you invite teammates to your organization so they can collaborate on clients, binders, and workpapers. This page walks through how to invite new members, manage pending invites, remove access, and use quick-share invite links.

<Callout kind="info">

You can invite teammates from either the **Manage organization** or **Manage users (admin)** views, depending on your permissions.

</Callout>

## Where to invite team members {#where-to-invite}

Use the organization switcher in the sidebar to access invite options.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Open the org switcher" icon="users">

  - Click the organization dropdown in the sidebar.
  - Confirm you are in the correct organization before inviting teammates.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Option 1: Manage organization → Members tab" icon="settings">

  - In the dropdown, select **Manage organization**.
  - Go to the **Members** tab to invite and manage team members.

  <Callout kind="tip">

  If you primarily work with team membership and roles, use the **Members** tab for a focused view.

  </Callout>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Option 2: Manage users (admin only)" icon="shield">

  - In the dropdown, select **Manage users (admin only)**.
  - Use the **Invite** button there to add new users.

  <Callout kind="alert">

  The **Manage users** menu is visible only to admins. If you do not see it, your role does not include admin permissions.

  </Callout>

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Understanding roles and permissions {#roles-and-permissions}

<Expandable title="Member roles" default-open="true">

SnappyTB uses roles to control what each teammate can see and do in your organization.

- **Preparer**: Handles day-to-day work, including edits and entries.
- **Detail Reviewer**, **Secondary Reviewer**, **Final Reviewer**: Focus on review permissions and different signoff stages.
- **Admin**: Has full access plus organization management capabilities.

<Callout kind="tip">

Assign the **minimum role needed** for each teammate&apos;s responsibilities to keep your organization secure and well-organized.

</Callout>

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Permissions and access notes" default-open="false">

- Only users with **Org Management** permissions can invite members.
- If you do not see the **Members** tab or **Invite** button, your role is too limited and you will need an admin to adjust your access.

<Callout kind="alert">

If you cannot invite members, check with an admin to confirm you have **Org Management** permissions or request a role update.

</Callout>

</Expandable>

## Invite a new member from the Members tab {#invite-from-members-tab}

Use the Members tab in **Manage organization** for a simple, role-aware invite flow.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Open the Members tab" icon="users">

  - Open the org switcher in the sidebar.
  - Select **Manage organization**.
  - Go to the **Members** tab.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter the teammate’s email" icon="terminal">

  - In the invite field, type the teammate&apos;s email address.
  - Confirm spelling before sending to avoid misdirected invites.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Select a role" icon="shield">

  - Choose a role such as **Preparer**, **Reviewer**, **Final Reviewer**, or **Admin**.
  - Match the role to the level of access they truly need.

  <Callout kind="tip">

  Use reviewer roles for signoff and review stages, and reserve **Admin** for those who manage the organization itself.

  </Callout>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Send the invite and confirm" icon="arrow-right">

  - Click **Invite**.
  - You will see a confirmation message.
  - The invite will appear under **Pending Invites** for tracking.
