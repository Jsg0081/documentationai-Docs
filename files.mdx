## Overview

The Files tab is your workpaper file manager for an engagement. You use it to:

- Store and organize workpapers
- Upload documents into folders
- Track review stages with signoffs
- Add review comments at the file or folder level

The Files tab has two main areas:

- **Toolbar (top)**: actions and navigation

## Toolbar actions

The toolbar at the top of the Files tab provides navigation and common actions.

<ExpandableGroup>

  <Expandable title="Breadcrumb path" default-open="true">

  The breadcrumb path shows where you are in the file tree.

  - If no folder is selected, the breadcrumb shows **Root**.
  - As you navigate into folders, the breadcrumb updates so you can see and move between levels.

  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="All Comments">

  **All Comments** opens the review comments dialog for the entire engagement.

  - Use this to see all comments across folders and files in one place.
  - From here, you can review, filter, and respond to comments without navigating item by item.

  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="Expand all / Collapse all">

  **Expand All** and **Collapse All** control the visibility of the folder tree:

  - **Expand All**: fully expands the folder tree so every folder level is visible.
  - **Collapse All**: closes all folders back to the top level.

  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="Add New Folder">

  **Add New Folder** creates a new folder in the file tree.

  - If a folder is selected, the new folder is created under that folder.
  - If no folder is selected, the new folder is created at the **Root** level.

  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="Upload Files">

  **Upload Files** uploads documents into the selected folder.

  - If you have a folder selected, files will upload into that folder.
  - If no folder is selected, you will be asked to choose a folder for the upload.

  <Callout kind="tip">

  To avoid extra clicks or misplaced uploads, select the destination folder in the file tree **before** choosing **Upload Files**.

  </Callout>

  </Expandable>

</ExpandableGroup>

## Navigating folders and files

### Selecting and expanding folders

- Click a folder row to **select** it. This selection controls where:
  - New folders are created when you click **Add New Folder**.
  - Files are uploaded when you click **Upload Files**.
- Click a folder row again (or its caret) to **expand** or **collapse** its child items.

### Opening files

- Click a file row to open it in a new browser tab.
- Files open when they have a stored URL associated with them.

<Callout kind="info">

If a file does not open when clicked, it may not have a URL yet (for example, it was not uploaded or linked properly). See **Common issues** for details.

</Callout>

## Organizing your files

You can reorganize your workpapers using drag and drop.

### Drag and drop behavior

- **Move into a folder**: drag a file or folder and drop it on top of a target folder to move it inside.
- **Reorder within a list**: drag and drop above or below another item to change the order inside the same parent.
- **Move back to root**: drag an item to the root drop zone to move it back to the top level of the file tree.

<Callout kind="alert">

When you move folders, all files and subfolders inside move with them. Review your structure before dragging high-level folders.

</Callout>

## Context menu actions

Right-click a file or folder (or use its more menu) to access context-specific actions.

<ExpandableGroup>

  <Expandable title="Folder actions">

  For folders, the context menu includes:

  - **New Folder**: adds a subfolder inside the selected folder.
  - **Rename**: changes the folder name.
  - **Delete**: removes the folder and all of its contents.

  <Callout kind="danger">

  Folder **Delete** is permanent for that folder and everything inside it. Double-check you are deleting the correct folder, especially at higher levels.

  </Callout>

  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="File actions">

  For files, the context menu includes:

  - **Rename**: changes the file name.
  - **Delete**: removes the file from the file tree.

  <Callout kind="alert">

  Deleting a file removes it from the engagement. Confirm that the file is no longer needed before deleting.

  </Callout>

  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="Review comments (files or folders)">

  You can attach review comments to both folders and files:

  - **Add Review Comment**: create a new comment thread on the selected item.
  - **View Review Comments**: see existing comments and replies on that item.

  Use item-level comments for specific questions or notes about a workpaper or folder, and use **All Comments** for an engagement-wide view.

  </Expandable>

</ExpandableGroup>

## Signoffs

Signoffs track review stages on individual files. They appear as small colored badges next to the file name.

<Callout kind="info">

Signoffs apply **only to files**, not folders. You will not see signoff options on folders in the context menu.

</Callout>

### Signoff stages

<Expandable title="Signoff stages and meaning" default-open="true">

Each signoff badge reflects a particular review stage:

- **P – Preparer**
- **D – Detail Reviewer**
- **S – Secondary Reviewer**
- **F – Final Reviewer**

Every signoff badge includes:

- Reviewer initials
- Date signed
- Time signed

</Expandable>

### Applying and removing signoffs

To sign off on a file:

1. Right-click the file row (or open its more menu).
2. Select **Sign Off**.
3. Choose the appropriate signoff stage (for example, Preparer, Detail Reviewer).

To remove a signoff:

1. Right-click the file row.
2. Select **Remove Signoff**.
3. Choose which stage to remove.

<Callout kind="alert">

Your role controls which signoff stages you can sign or remove. Higher-level roles can sign later stages. If you do not see a stage, your role may not have permission for that stage.

</Callout>

### Signoff display example

Signoffs appear as colored badges on the right side of the file row, one badge per stage. For example:

- `AB 01/15/26 3:42 PM` (Preparer)
- `JL 01/16/26 9:12 AM` (Detail Reviewer)

These help you quickly see which files are prepared, reviewed, or finalized.

## Review comments

Comments help you track review notes on specific items or across the entire engagement.

### Engagement-level comments

Use the toolbar **All Comments** button to:

- Open a dialog showing review comments for the entire engagement.
- Scan, filter, and respond to comments across all folders and files.

### Item-level comments

From the context menu on a folder or file:

- **Add Review Comment**:
  - Attach a new comment to that specific item.
  - Use this for questions, issues, or notes about a particular workpaper or folder.
- **View Review Comments**:
  - See existing comment threads on that item.
  - Reply or resolve as needed.

## Common issues

<Expandable title="Common issues and fixes" default-open="true">

- **Upload button does nothing**

  - **Cause**: no folder is selected before clicking **Upload Files**.
  - **Fix**: select the folder where you want to upload, then click **Upload Files** again.

- **Signoff menu is missing**

  - **Cause 1**: the selected item is a folder; signoffs only apply to files.
  - **Cause 2**: your role does not allow signing or removing that stage.
  - **Fix**: ensure you have selected a file, and confirm your role has permissions for the needed signoff stage.

- **File does not open**

  - **Cause**: the file may not have a URL stored yet (for example, it was not uploaded or linked properly).
  - **Fix**: verify that the file was uploaded or linked correctly. If needed, re-upload the file into the appropriate folder.
