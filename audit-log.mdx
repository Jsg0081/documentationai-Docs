description: Learn how to find, read, and use the audit log to track all activity inside a client binder.
---

## Overview

The audit log provides a complete history of activity inside a client binder. It tracks who did what, when it happened, and details of the change so you can review work, answer questions, and support compliance.

<Callout kind="info">

Only Admin users can view the Audit Log tab in a client binder. If you do not have Admin permissions, you will see a permission message instead of the log.

</Callout>

### Benefits and use cases

<Expandable title="Why the audit log matters" default-open="true">

Audit logs are critical for:

- **Accountability**: See exactly who changed a balance, uploaded a file, or signed off.
- **Review and quality control**: Quickly identify when adjustments were made and by whom.
- **Client or partner questions**: If something looks off, you can trace the exact action.
- **Compliance and documentation**: Audit logs provide a defensible trail of work performed.

## Permissions and access

Only Admin users can view the audit log. If you do not have access:

- Ask an Admin in your organization to grant you Admin permissions if you need to review audit history.

## Common issues

<Expandable title="Common issues and how to interpret them" default-open="true">

- **“Admin access required”**: You need Admin permissions to view the Audit Log tab.
- **No activity yet**: The log starts filling as users take actions in the client binder. A new or unused binder may show no entries yet.
