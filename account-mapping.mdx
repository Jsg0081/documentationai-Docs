## What the Account Mapping page does

The Account Mapping page is where you connect trial balance accounts to IRS form lines. You use it to:

- Prepare accounts for tax reporting
- Review how accounts roll up to form lines
- Validate totals and proofs of work

The page is divided into two main areas:

- **Accounts pane (left):** lists all trial balance accounts and their mapping status.
- **Form lines pane (right):** shows IRS form lines for the selected form and receives mappings.

A header at the top controls which form you are mapping to and offers AI and reset tools.

<Callout kind="info">

You can revisit Account Mapping at any time while working on a client. Changes update your tax form rollups immediately.

</Callout>

## Header tools

The header bar controls which tax form you are mapping and how mappings are created or cleared.

### Supported form types

<Expandable title="Supported tax forms" default-open="true">

The Account Mapping page supports mapping to these IRS forms:

- Form 1040
- Form 1065
- Form 1120
- Form 1120S

When you change the selected form, the available form lines in the right pane update to match that form.

</Expandable>

### Form selector

Use the **Form selector** to choose which IRS form the mapping follows. Changing the form:

- Updates all available form lines in the Form lines pane
- Keeps your mapping workflow focused on a single form at a time

### AI Suggest

The **AI Suggest** tool automatically maps any **unmapped** accounts.

- Only unmapped accounts are considered
- Mapped accounts are left as-is
- Progress is shown while AI runs (for example, accounts display "Mapping..." and animate)

### Clear All

The **Clear All** tool removes all existing mappings for the current form so you can restart from scratch.

<Callout kind="danger">

Use **Clear All** with caution. It clears **all** existing mappings for the current form. Only use it when you intentionally want to start over.

</Callout>

## Accounts pane (left side)

The Accounts pane is your list of trial balance accounts and the starting point for mapping.

### Finding and filtering accounts

You can quickly narrow down which accounts you are working with.

<Expandable title="Search and filter options" default-open="true">

- **Search:** type an account number, name, or type to filter the list instantly.
- **Filter tabs:** switch between:

  - **All:** show every account
  - **Mapped:** show only accounts that already have a mapping
  - **Unmapped:** show only accounts that still need mapping

</Expandable>

### Selecting accounts

You can select one or many accounts before you drag them to a form line.

<Steps>

<Step title="Select a single account" icon="check">

Click an account row in the Accounts pane to select it.

</Step>

<Step title="Multi-select accounts" icon="plus">

Use standard multi-select shortcuts:

- Hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (Windows) or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> (Mac) and click to add or remove individual accounts from the selection.
- Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> (Windows) or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> (Mac) to select all visible accounts in the current view (including applied filters).

</Step>

<Step title="Why selection matters" icon="info">

When you drag **any** selected account to a form line, **all selected accounts** are mapped together to that same form line.

</Step>

</Steps>

### Mapping and unmapping by dragging

Mapping is performed with drag and drop.

<Steps>

<Step title="Map accounts to a form line" icon="arrow-right">

1. Select one or more accounts in the Accounts pane.
2. Click and hold on one of the selected accounts.
3. Drag the selection to a **mappable** form line in the Form lines pane.
4. Drop the accounts on the line to assign them.

</Step>

<Step title="Unmap an account by dragging back" icon="minus">

1. Locate a mapped account you want to unmap.
2. Drag the account from its mapped location back over the Accounts pane.
3. When the Accounts pane highlights in red, release to drop.
4. The account is now unmapped.

</Step>

</Steps>

### Mapping status indicators and AI progress

Each mapped account shows status so you can see how mappings were created:

- **Target line label:** which form line the account is mapped to
- **AI / Manual badge:** whether the mapping was created by AI Suggest or manually
- **Green checkmark:** confirms the account is successfully mapped

When AI Suggest is running:

- Accounts being processed show a "Mapping..." message
- A visual animation indicates ongoing AI work

## Form lines pane (right side)

The Form lines pane shows the structure of the selected IRS form, including sections, line types, and mapping targets.

### Sections and expansion

Form lines are grouped into sections. You can expand or collapse each section using its header to focus on relevant areas of the form.

### Line types and colors

Form lines use color and type to signal how you can work with them.

<Expandable title="Line types and meaning" default-open="true">

Line types are color-coded:

- **Mappable (black):** accepts mappings from accounts via drag and drop or AI Suggest.
- **Subgroup (green):** represents a subgroup of lines. Often used as parents for sub-lines.
- **Calculated (blue):** cannot be mapped directly; totals are computed from other lines.
- **Manual / override (orange):** allows manual entry of a value instead of mapping accounts.

</Expandable>

### How to map to form lines

Mapping to form lines is always done via drag and drop or AI Suggest.

<Steps>

<Step title="Map accounts to a mappable line" icon="arrow-right">

1. In the Accounts pane, select one or more accounts.
2. In the Form lines pane, identify a **mappable** (non-calculated) line.
3. Drag your selected accounts onto that line.
4. Drop to assign the accounts to that line.

</Step>

</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">

Clicking a line **does not** map accounts. Mapping is done only by **dragging and dropping** or by using **AI Suggest**.

</Callout>

## Show Details and working with mapped accounts

The **Show Details** toggle controls whether you can see the specific accounts under each mapped line.

When **Show Details** is on:

- Each line reveals its contributing accounts
- You can see the account number, name, and value for each mapped account
- You can drag accounts from one line to another to remap them directly from the details view

This is especially useful as a **proof of what drives a line total** and when reviewing or adjusting mappings.

## Custom lines (sub-lines)

You can add custom sub-lines when you need more granularity under a parent form line.

### Adding custom sub-lines

There are two ways to add custom lines.

<Steps>

<Step title="Add a sub-line inline" icon="plus">

1. Hover over the form line where you want a sub-line.
2. Click the green **+** icon.
3. Enter a **Code** and **Label** for the new sub-line.
4. The new line appears immediately under the parent line.

</Step>

<Step title="Add a sub-line using Add Line" icon="plus">

1. Click the **Add Line** button.
2. Choose the **parent line** where the new sub-line should live.
3. Enter a **Code** and **Label**.
4. The custom line is added under the chosen parent.

</Step>

</Steps>

### Editing and deleting custom lines

Custom lines can be maintained directly in the Form lines pane:

- **Edit:** click the pencil (edit) icon to change the Code or Label.
- **Delete:** click the trash (delete) icon to remove the custom line.

When you delete a sub-line:

- The sub-line is removed from the form
- Any mappings attached to that sub-line are also removed

## Manual input lines

Some lines are designated as manual input or override lines.

You can recognize them because:

- They are shown in **orange**
- They have an edit icon

To enter a manual value:

<Steps>

<Step title="Enter a manual value" icon="edit">

1. Click the edit icon on the manual (orange) line.
2. Enter the value you want to use.
3. Save your changes.

</Step>

</Steps>

Manual input values:

- Are saved with your mapping
- Are used in totals and calculations
- Are helpful when items are not tied directly to any trial balance account

## Calculated lines and proof of work

Calculated lines summarize or derive values from other lines.

Key behavior:

- Displayed in **blue**
- Marked with a **Calc** badge
- **Cannot** accept direct mappings from accounts

Click the **Calc** badge on a calculated line to:

- See the formula used to compute the line
- View the contributing lines that roll into the calculation
- Access a proof-of-work breakdown showing the mapped accounts behind those contributing lines

This proof-of-work helps you verify that calculated totals align with your trial balance.

## Zoom and layout controls

You can adjust how form lines are displayed for better readability.

- **Zoom slider:** adjusts the scale of the Form lines pane, letting you zoom in for detail or zoom out for a broader view.
- **Hide zeros:** hides form lines that have zero totals and no mappings, reducing visual noise so you can focus on active lines.

## Summary totals

Summary totals at the bottom of the Form lines pane update in real time as you map accounts, add manual entries, and adjust lines.

<Expandable title="Summary totals by form type" default-open="true">

For **Forms 1120 / 1120S / 1065**, you can see:

- Total Assets
- Total Liabilities
- Total Equity
- Total Income
- Total Deductions
- Net Income (Loss)

For **Form 1040**, you can see:

- Schedule C Net Profit
- Schedule E Net Income
- Schedule F Net Profit
- Combined Net

</Expandable>

These summaries provide a quick sanity check that your mapped totals align with expectations.

## Common issues and fixes

Use this section to troubleshoot typical Account Mapping problems.

<Expandable title="Common issues and how to resolve them" default-open="true">

- **"All accounts are already mapped":**  
  AI Suggest only maps **unmapped** accounts. If all visible accounts are already mapped, AI Suggest has nothing to do.

- **Cannot drop on a line:**  
  You may be trying to drop on a **calculated** (blue) line, which does not accept mappings. Drag to a **mappable** (black) line instead.

- **Nothing appears under a line:**  
  Turn on **Show Details** to see contributing accounts, or map accounts manually by dragging them from the Accounts pane.

- **Cannot unmap an account:**  
  Drag the mapped account back over the **Accounts pane**. When the pane highlights red, drop to unmap.
