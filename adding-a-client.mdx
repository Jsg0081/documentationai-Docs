/**Where To Add A Client**

1. Dashboard: Click "Create First Client" (shown when no client is selected).

2. Sidebar: In the "Clients" section, click the plus (+) icon.

## **Steps To Add A New Client**

1. Open the "Create New Client" dialog using one of the options above.

2. Fill in the client fields (see the field reference below).

3. Click "Create Client".

After creation, SnappyTB routes you to the new client dashboard automatically.

## **Field Reference (What Each Field Means)**

1. Client Name (required)\
   Client Name is the primary display name for the client. It appears in the sidebar, dashboard tiles, and client lists. Example: "ABC Corporation".

2. Client ID (optional)\
   Client ID is a short internal identifier. It must be letters and numbers only and must be unique within your organization. Example: "ABC123". Use this for fast search, consistent naming, or internal integrations.

3. Company Legal Name (optional)\
   Company Legal Name is the official legal entity name. Use this if the client operates under a DBA or trade name. Example: "ABC Corporation Inc.".

4. Tax ID / EIN (optional)\
   Tax ID / EIN stores the client's tax identifier. The field accepts free-form input and may include dashes. Example: "12-3456789".

5. Fiscal Year End (optional)\
   Fiscal Year End is the month and day that closes the client's fiscal year. You select a month-end date from a list. Example: "December 31" (stored as "12/31").

## **Validation Rules And Tips**

- Client Name is required.

- Client ID must be alphanumeric and unique per organization.

- All other fields are optional and can be added later by editing the client.

## **After You Create A Client**

- You are routed to the client dashboard.

- The client appears in the sidebar and recent clients list.

- You can edit the client later from the client context menu by choosing "Edit Client".

## **Troubleshooting**

- "Client name is required": Add a value to Client Name.

- "Client ID must be alphanumeric": Remove spaces or special characters.

- "Client ID already in use": Choose a different Client ID or remove it.

- "No active organization found": Make sure you are signed in and have an active organization selected.
