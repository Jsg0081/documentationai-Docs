# **Client Binders: Edit, Delete, Roll Forward**

Binders are the client’s year folders shown on the client detail page. Each binder represents a fiscal year (or period) and opens into its own engagement workspace.

## **Where To Find Binders**

1. Open a client from the sidebar or dashboard.

2. Scroll to the Binders section (grid or table view).

You can toggle between tile view and table view using the view switcher.

## **Open A Binder**

1. Click any binder card (tile view) or row (table view).

2. You will be taken to that binder’s engagement workspace.

## **Edit A Binder**

You can edit a binder’s year, name, and accounting period.

1. Find the binder in the list.

2. Click the Edit icon (pencil).

3. Update the fields.

4. Click Save.

Fields in the Edit dialog:

1. Year: The fiscal year of the binder. Must be a number (e.g., 2025).

2. Name: Display name for the binder (optional).

3. Accounting Period From: Start date for the period (optional).

4. Accounting Period To: End date for the period (optional).

## **Delete A Binder**

Deleting a binder is permanent and cannot be undone.

1. Find the binder in the list.

2. Click the Delete icon (trash).

3. Confirm the deletion.

## **Roll Forward A Binder**

Roll Forward creates a new binder for the next year using the current binder as a template.

1. Find the binder you want to roll forward.

2. Click the Roll Forward icon (fast‑forward).

3. Fill out the roll forward fields.

4. Click Roll Forward.

Fields in the Roll Forward dialog:

1. Target Year: The fiscal year for the new binder (required).

2. Binder Name: Optional display name for the new binder.

3. Accounting Period From: Start date for the new period.

4. Accounting Period To: End date for the new period.

5. Copy Account Mappings: Toggle to carry forward tax mappings.

What Roll Forward copies:

- Chart of accounts.

- Perm File documents and folders.

- Tax mappings if Copy Account Mappings is enabled.

What Roll Forward does not copy:

- Trial balance values (start at zero).

- Journal entries.

- Workpapers other than Perm File.

After a successful roll forward, SnappyTB will take you directly to the new binder.

## **Tips And Notes**

- If the Year field is not a valid number, the system will reject the change.

- Accounting Period dates are optional but recommended for clarity.

- If you’re unsure, edit instead of delete to preserve history.
